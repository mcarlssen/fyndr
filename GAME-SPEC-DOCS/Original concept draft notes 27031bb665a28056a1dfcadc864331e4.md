SCORING

**F*irst‑gen points algorithm (purchase‑friendly but not pay‑to‑win)***

*Goals: reward placement quality and genuine social spread, not raw volume or spam.*

*Base:*

*When your sticker is scanned by a unique device in a 7‑day window: Owner +2, Scanner +1*

*Diminishing returns per sticker: after 3 scans/day per sticker, owner earns +1, then +0.5*

*Unique-scanner streak bonus: first scan from a unique device per day yields +1 extra to the scanner*

*Placement and diversity quality:*

*Geo diversity bonus: +1 if scan occurs >500m from last scan of the same sticker that day*

*Venue variety bonus: +1 for first scan at a new place category this week*

*Social sneeze multiplier: if a scanner goes on to cause 3+ downstream scans within 7 days, the original sticker owner gets a +3 “sneeze” bonus. Cap per chain per week to prevent runaway loops*

*Anti‑spam and integrity:*

*Per-device daily cap on earning points from the same sticker*

*Cooldown for rescans by same device at same location*

*Downweight scans that cluster too tightly in time/location or come from GPS‑spoof patterns*

*Progression and redemption:*

*Level tiers unlock “fancier” stickers that multiply both owner and scanner points by 1.2–1.5*

*Redemption: 50–100 points for 1 sticker pack, or cosmetic-only perks at lower thresholds*

*Wallet loop: bonus points if you buy bundles, but ensure equivalent points are earnable via play*

*Tuning knobs to keep:*

*Owner base points: 1.5–2.5*

*Scanner base points: 0.75–1.25*

*Diminishing thresholds and geo radius*

*Weekly caps per sticker and per account to protect the economy*

get mega extra points for inviting friends - form a leaderboard with them, get reduced points from their stickers

redeem 50 points (maybe higher?) to get a pack of stickers OR you can buy a pack for like $2.

HOW TO GAMIFY?

need a leaderboard of some kind - how is progress represented? cumulative score?

bonus points for diversity and number of other people’s stickers scanned

need an algorithm that takes social sneezing into account as well as raw sticker scans

- Onboarding quest: “Place 3 stickers in distinct venue categories” to unlock first cosmetic
- Friend rings: auto‑leaderboards for invited friends, with “assist” bonuses when you scan each other’s stickers weekly
- Local events: weekly “hot zones” on the heatmap with double points
- Seasonal themes: limited designs tied to holidays or campus events
- Streaks and comeback boosts: protect streaks with a small fee or an ad watch
- Collections: complete city or theme sets for badges that add small multipliers
- UGC templates: co-create designs within guardrails; unlocking templates is a progression reward
- Clubs: small teams compete in weekend challenges, pooled milestone rewards
    
    

ADD’L IDEAS

- if a user enables gps position on their device, the game could build a “heatmap” of stickers, with some ambiguity for fun. this could display sticker density, hint at high-value stickers, indicate where the game is likely to be most fun, etc etc.
- Sponsorships: local businesses buy “sponsored sticker zones,” treasure hunts, or boosted map pins. These can out-earn classic ads on a per-user basis in high-density areas.
- Treasure routes: clue chains leading across multiple neighborhoods
- Time‑window bounties: scan a sticker between 6–9 pm for extra points
- “Decay and refresh”: stickers fade in value over time unless they get a fresh unique scan
- NPC “courier missions”: deliver a sticker to a new area to seed a new cluster
- Partner hunts: coffee shops and libraries host “gold foil” stickers with boosted rewards
- Creator drops: limited collaborator sticker sets with special multipliers

### Heatmap and discovery

- Privacy‑safe heatmap with jittered aggregation cells
- “Hot now” tags surfaced when a cell exceeds a rolling baseline
- Rotate “featured neighborhoods” to prevent single‑city lock‑in

### Virality loops

- Invite‑to‑unlock: invites open a friend leaderboard and grant both sides a limited-time multiplier
- Brag moments: shareable recap cards after a “big sneeze” chain
- Co‑op milestones: teams unlock cosmetic frames and map skins
