# Simulator

Since the hands is entirely math based, we need a game simulator that allows us to test and refine the economy. 

This should be constructed such that the outcomes from these runs (the input variable sets) can be easily measured and translated to the actual game variables (i.e. don’t make it hard to PR changes!).

ACTION ITEM: establish what a baseline “player” behavior is, how many scans they do, how much area they cover, etc. 

As real-world data comes in, the economy should be able to be easily re-simulated and refined, allowing rapid adaptation and micro-economies based on player behavior in discrete areas.

**The real use for this is in simulating long periods of game economy at various scales and densities PRIOR to game launch.**
