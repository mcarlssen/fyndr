## Summary

A real‑world social scavenger game that uses QR stickers to spark in‑person discovery and friendly competition. Players place stickers, scan others, and climb leaderboards. Monetization is freemium: optional micro‑purchases of sticker packs and rewarded ads. Core goal: fun, viral, and outdoorsy — with a modest annual revenue target in the low/mid five figures.

## Objectives

- Fun, quick to learn, and socially contagious
- Drive IRL exploration and safe placement behavior
- Sustainable unit economics with optional purchases and rewarded ads
- Privacy‑respecting location features (opt‑in, jittered aggregation)

## Target users

- Gen Z, 18–24, especially campus‑centric cohorts with high walkability
- Early sneezers: club organizers, creators, local businesses who host stickers

## Core loop

1) Place stickers → 2) Others scan → 3) Earn points and climb leaderboards → 4) Unlock new stickers and in-app cosmetics → 5) Invite friends and form teams

## First‑gen points system (freemium‑friendly, not pay‑to‑win)

- Base: Unique scan within 7 days → Owner +2, Scanner +1
- Diminishing returns: after 3 scans/day per sticker → Owner +1 then +0.5
- Streaks: First unique scan per device per day → +1 (scanner)
- Geo diversity: +1 if >500m from last scan of same sticker that day
- Venue variety: +1 for first scan at a new place category this week
- Social sneeze: If a scanner causes 3+ downstream scans in 7 days → Owner +3 bonus (cap per chain/week)
- Integrity: per‑device caps, cooldowns on rescans, spoofing detection and down‑weights
- Progression: higher levels unlock sticker designs with 1.2–1.5x multipliers
- Redemption: 50–100 points → 1 sticker pack or cosmetics at lower thresholds

## Freemium and ads

- Micro‑purchases of physical sticker packs and wallet top‑ups
- Rewarded ads to protect streaks or earn small boosters (opt‑in only)
- Local sponsorships: featured zones, treasure routes, or boosted pins

# Unit‑economics mini‑calculator (v0)

Use this section to plug your assumptions and see directional outcomes. Numbers here are illustrative — edit them directly.

### Assumptions

- Price per 6‑pack (P): $3.00
- Packs per active buyer per season (C): 2.7  (≈ 8 months active, 1 pack/90 days)
- Payment fee: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Avg packs per transaction (B): 2.0  (wallet/bundle to amortize fixed fee)
- Sticker unit cost: $0.09 each (durable QR vinyl, 5–10k run)
- Pack contains 6 stickers → Sticker material per pack: $0.54
- Packaging + pick/pack per shipment: $0.30
- Postage per shipment (machinable letter): $0.73
- Variable support/reship allowance per pack: $0.10

### Derived per‑pack unit costs (with bundles)

- Payment fee per pack = (0.029 × (P×B) + 0.30) / B
- COGS per pack = sticker material ($0.54)
- Fulfillment per pack = packaging ($0.30) + postage ($0.73) all divided by B if shipping once per 2 packs
- Support allowance per pack = $0.10

| Metric | Formula | Value (B=2) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payment fee/pack | (0.029×(P×B)+0.30)/B | $0.19 |
| COGS/pack | 6×$0.09 | $0.54 |
| Fulfillment/pack | ($0.30+$0.73)/B | $0.52 |
| Support allowance | Fixed | $0.10 |
| <strong>Total variable cost/pack</strong> | Sum of above | <strong>$1.35</strong> |
| <strong>Contribution/pack</strong> | P − total cost | <strong>$1.65</strong> |

### Seasonal revenue and contribution per active buyer

- Revenue per buyer per season = P × C = $3.00 × 2.7 = $8.10
- Packs purchased per season = C = 2.7
- Contribution per buyer per season = 2.7 × $1.65 = $4.46

### Hitting a $50k annual revenue target (illustrative)

- If 60% of active users purchase at least once per season and buyers average C=2.7 packs:
    - Total packs needed for $50k revenue at P=$3 → 16,667 packs/year
    - With 60% buyer rate → you need ≈ 10,300 seasonal active users, of whom ≈ 6,200 buy
- Ad/sponsor offset: light rewarded ads at $0.20–$0.50 ARPU/season can cover shortfalls

Notes to tune

- If sticking with $2.00 price, bundle B must rise or shipping must be charged to keep contribution ≥ $0.80/pack
- Wallet top‑ups ($5–$10) amortize the $0.30 fixed payment fee and improve contribution

# v1 backlog (lean pilot)

## Foundations

- Account, auth, and device attestation
- QR code generation and per‑sticker unique IDs with anti‑reprint checks
- Location opt‑in, coarse and precise modes, privacy policy
- Basic analytics: scans, placements, DAU/WAU, invite attribution

## Core gameplay

- Place sticker flow with photo proof and simple placement guidelines
- Scan flow: instant points, ownership detection, anti‑rescan cooldowns
- Friend leaderboard and small “rings” (auto‑group invited friends)
- Weekly hot zones: double‑points areas surfaced on a privacy‑safe heatmap
- Points engine implementing the first‑gen algorithm and caps

## Economy and monetization

- Store: 6‑pack at $3, bundle 2‑pack checkout, $5 wallet top‑up
- Rewarded ad placements: protect streak, small boost, or revive
- Redemption: 50–100 points → 1 sticker pack or cosmetics
- Inventory and order management, shipment tracking emails

## Content and cosmetics

- 8–12 curated sticker sets at launch, level‑gated multipliers (1.2x–1.5x)
- Seasonal themes and campus event variants
- Lightweight UGC templates behind progression gates

## Integrity and safety

- Spoofing detection: GPS/time clustering and risk scoring
- Per‑device and per‑sticker daily caps, cool‑downs, and flags
- Report‑a‑sticker flow and moderation tooling
- In‑app safety tips and placement rules

## Partnerships (optional pilot stretch)

- Local business “gold foil” stickers with boosted rewards
- Sponsored map pins and treasure routes

## Ops

- Print partner integration, batch ID registration
- SLA and re‑ship policy, customer support macros
- Tax, shipping, and ToS/Privacy compliance

# Open questions

- Price point: $3 incl. shipping vs. $2 + shipping — which do we test first?
- Launch geography: which campus or neighborhood for pilot?
- Creator pipeline: curated sets only at launch or limited UGC?
- Ads: rewarded only, or any banner/interstitial inventory on low‑intent screens?
- Safety bar: how strict should placement rules and prompts be?
