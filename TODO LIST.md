work out the economics between points reinvestment for grinders/casuals vs. cash infusion for whales. 
should points-to-dollars value be way higher? cost of stickers way higher?

apparently viral spread is too low to cause viral growth at start. Need to either start with more players/stickers, or find a way to incentivize higher viral spreading.


GAME DESIGN ISSUES TO RESOLVE

**fundamentally the game has a retention problem. how do we build growth without cost (i.e. attract new players) OR incentivise viral spreading?**

*analyze sticker density rules - this doesn't have a good IRL benchmark as it will vary widely depending on the environment.*

*what happens to a player's stickers when that player goes inactive?* should there be a bounty on "claiming" stickers of inactive players? this could be an interesting retention mechanism.

Note 9/28 11:52pm: model is reliably producing 30% retention regardless of starting population. This settles within the first 30 days or so.
