work out the economics between points reinvestment for grinders/casuals vs. cash infusion for whales. 
should points-to-dollars value be way higher? cost of stickers way higher?

analyze sticker density rules - possibly currently broken

apparently viral spread is too low to cause viral growth at start. Need to either start with more players/stickers, or find a way to incentivize higher viral spreading.
