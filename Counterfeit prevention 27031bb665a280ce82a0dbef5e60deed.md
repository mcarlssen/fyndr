# Counterfeit prevention

### 4) Counterfeit and spoofing: layered, low-cost defense

Think “cheap layers plus server brains,” reserving expensive materials for prestige runs.

- Core digital controls
    - Per-sticker unique ID, encoded in QR with short cryptographic token.
    - Server-verified scan: app sends token + device attestation + coarse location and time.
    - One-time activation: first placement must include a photo and brief GPS proof; afterward, anomaly checks watch for teleporting or clustering.
    - Risk scoring: downrank scans from suspicious patterns, throttle suspect stickers, and request re-verification.
- Cheap-to-scale physical cues
    - Microtext ring in the QR quiet zone that human printers struggle to replicate cleanly.
    - Variable data printing: tiny per-sticker art variation or color dot pattern derived from the ID.
    - Black UV ink or spot UV gloss over the code area; cheap at volume, hard to notice and emulate without UV light.
- Mid-cost upgrades for higher tiers and promos
    - Holographic laminate or rainbow foil base for limited runs.
    - Clear vinyl with white-ink underprint for a premium look.
    - Soft-touch matte overlam that feels distinct to the touch.
    Use these selectively to protect margin.
- Operational spot checks
    - Community reporting: “suspected fake” reports earns small points (1/10 to 1/3 point).
    - Auditor packs: randomly seeded NFC “sentinels” on a fraction of stickers in dense zones to calibrate the risk model, not for every sticker.
- Optional NFC, used sparingly
    - Not for baseline COGS. Include on 1–5% of showcase stickers or partner promos where budget allows. The app can accept either QR or NFC for those units.
